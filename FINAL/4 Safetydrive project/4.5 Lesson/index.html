        <h3>LESSONS LEARNED</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Simplicity Improves Adoption</li>
            <p>We learned that even small complexities in the ordering flow like unclear filters or multiple confirmation steps could lead to drop offs. By simplifying the user journey and making key actions obvious, we improved usability and engagement significantly.</p>
            <li>Trust and Safety</li>
            <p>Beyond functionality, users need to feel safe and secure when using any delivery platform. Implementing the security box and PIN system taught me how much value users place on trust, privacy, and control, especially when their health and personal data are involved.</p>
            <li>Good Design Solves Real Problems</li>
            <p>This project reinforced the idea that design isn't just about aesthetics, itâ€™s about solving real world problems. From preventing food tampering to ensuring correct deliveries, thoughtful design decisions can genuinely improve lives.</p>
            <li>Collaboration</li>
            <p>Working alongside testers, developers, and stakeholders showed me how important cross functional collaboration is. Great ideas come to life faster and better when feedback are open and communication is clear.</p>
