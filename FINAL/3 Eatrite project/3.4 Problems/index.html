        <h3>THE PROBLEM FACED</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Identified Issue:
                <p>During usability testing and user feedback sessions, we discovered that many users were struggling to successfully place orders from their preferred restaurants through the platform. Key pain points included confusing navigation, unclear restaurant availability, and inconsistent meal customization optionsâ€”all of which contributed to a frustrating user experience.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Impact:
                <p>This usability issue had a significant effect on user satisfaction and retention. Data showed that nearly 50% of users were unable to complete their orders from their favorite restaurants. Consequently, many of them were forced to resort to alternative, often less desirable food options such as roadside vendors. This not only affected the overall trust in the platform but also posed a risk to user health and satisfaction, as users felt the platform could not reliably meet their needs. The problem highlighted a critical gap in the user journey, emphasizing the need to streamline the ordering process, improve restaurant filtering, and offer a more intuitive, accessible interface for users of all levels.</p>
