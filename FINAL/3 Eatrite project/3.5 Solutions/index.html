        <h3>THE SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED</h3>
        <div>
            <p>To address the usability challenges, I designed a user-friendly food ordering app that allows users to seamlessly place orders from their favorite restaurant. The app features a simplified user flow, clear navigation, and smart restaurant filtering—making it easier for users to find and order exactly what they want.</p>
            <p>With an intuitive interface and streamlined checkout process, users can now browse menus, customize meals, and complete orders in just a few taps. Once an order is placed, it is delivered directly to their doorstep within a short and reliable delivery window.</p>
            <p>This solution not only improves the overall user experience but also restores confidence in the platform’s ability to meet their everyday food needs efficiently.</p>
