        <h3>SECURITY & TRUST: PREVENTING DELIVERY ISSUES</h3>
        <div>
            <p>To enhance user safety and trust in the delivery process, we implemented a secure delivery system that addresses several common pain points, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Food poisoning from mishandled meals</li>
                <li>Deliveries made to the wrong person or address</li>
                <li>Carriers tampering with or eating parts of the order</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our solution includes a smart security box paired with a unique PIN verification system. When a user places an order, the meal is sealed inside a tamper-proof security box. Upon delivery, the user is prompted to enter a one-time PIN (sent to them during checkout) to unlock the box and receive their order. This feature ensures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Only the intended recipient can access the meal</li>
                <li>Orders remain sealed and untouched during transit</li>
                <li>Peace of mind for users, especially in high-risk areas</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By introducing this system, we significantly increased user confidence in the platform, reduced complaints related to order safety, and created a more professional and secure delivery experience.</p>
